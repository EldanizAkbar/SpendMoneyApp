# SpendMoneyApp
I utilized HTML and CSS for creating the websiteâ€™s structure and styling.

JavaScript played a pivotal role in adding interactive elements and functionality to the website.

An API was employed to fetch product photos, enriching the visual representation of items available for purchase.

Leveraging React, I built dynamic components, providing a seamless user experience for managing expenses.
